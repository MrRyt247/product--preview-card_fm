## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

``` CSS
@media only screen and (max-width: 430px) {

}
```

### Continued development

- Imported fonts
- Responsive mobile design

### Useful resources

- [Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helps with the mobile design.
